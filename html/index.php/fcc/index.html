			<p>With the war in Viet Nam going on and Bill about to graduate from high school, a letter came to the Borgman home, from the Federal Government.&nbsp; Holding his breath, Bill opened the letter.&nbsp; It was not a call to war.&nbsp; It was a job offer with the FCC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bill could not go directly to Grand Island, Nebraska.&nbsp; He was missing one credit for graduation, PE.&nbsp; Although he was an excellant swimmer with a life saving certificate, Bill took one hour of beginning swimming to earn his final credit for graduation.</p>
<p>Having been transferred to Allegan, Michigan, Bill was responsible for inspections of ships, television and radio stations in five states.&nbsp; He was proud of telling people that he was there to help solve whatever the problem was and go on, not write citations.&nbsp; This won him friends all over the country.&nbsp; He covered one of the Democratic Conventions during a Presidential election.&nbsp; Had met Ralph Nader and many other national figures.</p>
<p>He was a problem solver.&nbsp; He helped to start a co-operation between ham radio operators, cb'ers and the police department in working together to monitor the safety on the streets during Halloween.&nbsp; (Photo above.)</p>
<p>His work with the FCC and being a ham radio operator lead him to start his own company Prosoft Plus.&nbsp; Designing his own logging program.&nbsp; This started his good and long term relationship with Ten Tec founder Al Kahn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prosoft Plus was just a part of Bill's busy life.&nbsp; He enjoyed&nbsp;his spot at&nbsp;Dayton Hamvention.</p>		</div>
